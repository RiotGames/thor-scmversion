Feature: Guessing the level of a bump
  As a user
  I want a command that figures out a major, minor or patch bump based on commit logs
  So that I can control semver changes while still using a CI server

  Scenario Outline: changeset tags
    Given I have a git project of version '<starting version>'
    And a commit with the message "<message 1>" on the "master" branch
    And a commit with the message "<message 2>" on the "master" branch
    And a commit with the message "<message 3>" on the "master" branch
    When I run `bundle exec thor version:bump auto` from the temp directory
    Then the version should be '<resulting version>'
    # TODO: Figure out how to set up remote branch tracking so this
    # does not have to be called explicitly
    And I run `git push origin master --tags` from the temp directory
    And the <scm> server version should be '<resulting version>'

  Examples:
    | starting version | scm | message 1 | message 2          | message 3               | resulting version |
    |            1.2.3 | git | untagged  | another commit     | another change          | 1.2.3+build.2     |
